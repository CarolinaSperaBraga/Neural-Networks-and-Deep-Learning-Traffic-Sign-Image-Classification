# Traffic-Sign-Image-Classification

Accurate and fast identification of traffic signs is a task of great importance for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. The ability of a vehicle to effectively recognize and interpret traffic signs significantly contributes to road safety and efficiency, preventing accidents and assisting navigation.

In this project, we address the task of traffic sign classification by developing and comparing different architectures for automatic classification. We explore traditional methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have proven to be extremely effective in pattern recognition tasks in images, and transfer learning algorithms.

By comparing traditional and modern methods, we provide insights into the advantages and limitations of each approach.

The project is structured as follows:

- Data Description: Details the dataset used, including its structure and preprocessing.
- Baseline: Presents the SVM baseline method and its results.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Describes the CNN architectures implemented, including a basic CNN and a deeper one, along with their results.
- Transfer Learning: Describes the architecture of the algorithm using the deep convolutional neural network model VGG16 and its results.
- Conclusion: A summary of the results obtained and discussions about the most effective approaches.
- References: Cites the references used throughout the project.
